		<h2> New York City</h2>
		<p> Many people ask me, why New York? why did you choose NYC out of so many other beautiful places in America? My answer to them is, I have not chosen New York, it chose me which is very rare because New York welcomes only those who are ready to give up everything that is easy and comfortable in order to fulfill their dreams and explore. It is not the draft beer or pizza vendors or times square that attracts tourists, It is the energy that exists in the air.</p>

		<h2> City of Dreams </h2>
		<p> New York for me, city of dreams. With high significance of fast pace life and full spectrum view of day to day life I would say New York is an oasis for people looking for traveling, multi cultural experience and food.</p>

		<h2> Explore and Experince this city</h2>
		<p> I love New York for its lifestyle, strength to sustain in the worst weather yet see summer coming and most importantly I love it for what it offers. It offers opportunity to everyone regardless of race, ethnicity and culture, it supplies a lot of power into you by making you competent enough to fight the odds yet hope for the best 
		To sum up I would say come to explore New York and you might end up exploring more than New York. </p>
